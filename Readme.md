# Trash-Tech

Trash Tech is a project that utilizes machine learning techniques to classify images of trash into different categories, such as dry waste, wet waste, bio-medical waste and hazardous waste. This project aims to automate the process of waste sorting and promote effective waste management practices. The Trash Tech utilizes image classification techniques to analyze and categorize images of trash items based on their visual characteristics. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the classifier learns patterns and features from labelled images to make predictions on unseen images.
